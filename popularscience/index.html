<a href="https://github.com/adrianmruf/DeBruijnCardTrick">What if we used math to do card tricks?</a> 26.04.2023. Presentation of <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/01/mathematics_and_magic_the_de_b.html">The de Bruijn Card Trick</a> using de Bruijn sequences and linear feedback shift registers. The trick has five audience members cut a deck of cards repeatedly and then take a card each. The mathematician then asks a few questions: “Who had porridge for breakfast?” “Who is holding a red card?” “Is anyone a Pisces?” “Who has a dog called Stanley?”. The answers to these questions are sufficient to allow the mathematician to name the card that each person is holding. <a href="https://github.com/adrianmruf/DeBruijnCardTrick">Here</a> you find a python script that takes the relevant information ("Who is holding a red card?") and compiles a LaTeX beamer presentation with the five cards the audience members are holding on the title page.
